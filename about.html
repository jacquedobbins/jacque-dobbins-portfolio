        I’m a content strategist, writer, and editor currently based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be safe to say I have a passion for content&mdash;both consuming and creating it. My career began with communications, copywriting, and editorial work. I worked for magazines, academic journals, and newspapers, often working within the space of traditional print media. But I always wanted to push it further. Get out of ink and into code.
      </p>
      <p>
        While still working in more traditional communications roles, I developed my web content strategy skills, learning HTML and CSS (and coding this website), researching SEO and accessibility best practices, and delving into UX and information architecture. Not long after, I turned my part-time hustle into a full-time job as the lead copywriter and content strategist at Westminster College. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My diverse professional background has given me an appreciation for the marriage of strategic vision, analytics, and creativity in content strategy. I believe that web work is inherently collaborative—the less we silo our work, the better the user experience will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun, I co-founded a minimalist fashion blog&mdash;although we talk about a lot more than just fashion&mdash;and love exploring aesthetics, from fashion and art to architecture and graphic design. I also enjoy staying up all night reading (naturally), trying not to kill my sourdough starter (Carl), traveling as often as possible, spending as much time outside as I can, and, let’s be honest, bingeing on whatever new show is on my radar.
