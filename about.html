        I’m an editor, writer, and designer specializing in web content and design in Salt Lake City, Utah. How I came to that descriptor has been a somewhat unusual journey. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered my love of editing at a young age, graduating from school newspapers and alumni magazines to academic journals, books, and nuclear remediation manuals. You read that correctly. I ended up in the world of technical editing for government contractors focused on environmental cleanup and nuclear energy. Not what I expected, but my love of punctuation and grammar doesn’t discriminate.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey with writing has been similarly varied. I found my love of writing in the world of journalism, but as my experience grew I found myself dabbling in script writing, ghostwriting, and technical writing. As a freelance technical writer, I create content on all things scientific from nuclear cleanup and genetic research to medical device innovation and diabetes. I am most definitely not a scientist, but I am curious, which has proven to be one of my most valuable skills as a writer. Now, my interests have gone digital—as with most things today—focusing on content strategy and web writing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My design experience began with an interest the aesthetically pleasing&mdash;fashion, interiors, and graphics. An interest in exploring all facets of the content creation process inspired me to make the leap from creating and editing content to also designing it. I found my design outlet in web design, initially using content management systems like Squarespace and Wordpress before honing my HTML and CSS skills and delving into SEO, UX, and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun, I do all of the above. Naturally. But really&mdash;though I do like my work&mdash;I also enjoy staying up all night reading, traveling as often as possible, exploring Utah’s great outdoors, hosting impromptu dance parties, and, let’s be honest, bingeing on whatever new show is on my radar.
