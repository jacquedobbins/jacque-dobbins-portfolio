        I hate writing about myself. It’s uncomfortable, but this an about page, so I have to do it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a writer, editor, and designer specializing in web content and design in Salt Lake City, Utah. How I came to that descriptor
        has been a somewhat unusual journey.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered my love of editing at a young age, graduating from school newspapers and alumni magazines to academic journals, 
        books, and nuclear remediation manuals. You read that correctly. I ended up in the world of technical editing for government 
        contractors focused on environmental cleanup and nuclear energy. Not what I expected, but my love of punctuation and grammar 
        doesn’t discriminate.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey with writing has been similarly varied. I found my love of writing in the world of journalism, but as my experience 
        grew I found myself dabbling in script writing and adding ghostwriting to my repertoire. And, you guessed it, I eventually found
        myself freelancing as a technical writer—writing about all things scientific from nuclear cleanup and genetic research to medical 
        device innovation and diabetes. I am most definitely not a scientist, but I am curious, which has proven to be my most valuable 
        skill as a writer. Now, I’ve gone digital—as with most things today—exploring content strategy and web writing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Design and I have a much less interesting past. I’ve always been a fan of the aesthetically pleasing—fashion, interiors, and 
        graphics. So, I made the leap from creating and editing content to also designing it. Graphic design is great, but I found my 
        design outlet in web design, initially exploring using CMS like Squarespace and Wordpress, honing my html and css skills, and 
        delving into SEO, UX, and accessibility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun… I do all of the above. Naturally. But really—though I do enjoy my work—I also really enjoy staying up all night reading, 
        traveling as often as possible, exploring Utah’s great outdoors, hosting impromptu dance parties, and, let’s be honest, bingeing on
        whatever new—or old—show is on my radar. 
      </p>

        There. I did it. I now have a proper bio for my about page.
