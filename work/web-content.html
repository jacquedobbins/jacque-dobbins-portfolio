          My client was looking to redesign her personal website and move from Wordpress to Squarespace. We met initially to discuss her vision for the site and how she wanted to use it. I worked with her to determine what content should be included and developed an organization strategy. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Delving into the design process, I compiled a list of the Squarespace templates that fit my client’s vision. We narrowed it down to two, and I created mock sites with each template to help my client choose a final design. Once I had collected all her articles, images, and copy, I worked in Squarespace to create her site, customizing the template as necessary. 
          <br>
          <br>  
          After the site was completed, I met with my client to go through the Squarespace interface, showing her how to maintain the site. I’ve continued to be available as she has questions about using Squarespace.

        <p class="body-text">
          A local dog-breeding business was looking to redesign their site and move from Weebly to a new CMS. Initially, I created a new site using Wordpress; however, the backend user interface wasn’t what the company was looking for, proving to be difficult to maintain. After discussing the options, we decided to move to Squarespace. Though I had pared down and rewritten their content during the first redesign, I decided to use this opportunity to further simplify the site.
          <br>
          <br> 
          I analyzed the current site content, providing detailed feedback to the business. They agreed that there were too many pages and too much copy. I worked with the owners to rewrite and streamline site content, keeping the tone consistent with their brand voice and tone.
          <br>
          <br> 
          Continuing to work within the brand guidelines, I began the design process. I selected a couple Squarespace templates and created mock-ups to help my clients choose a final design. Though they preferred one, their vision required more customization. Keeping their notes and vision in mind, I created the site, requesting consistent feedback and conducting frequent testing.

          After the site was completed, I met with the owners to go through the Squarespace interface, showing them how to maintain the site.

      <h4>content strategy</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
          While working at Westminster College as the Interim Director of Publications and Managing Editor, I took on some additional projects with the web team. The college was in the middle of a website redesign and didn’t have a clear vision for the program pages. I volunteered to do some digging to determine best practices and see what other colleges were doing. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Jumping off from my research, I began compiling an academic program template that our freelance web writers could use to draft copy. I kept the content in-line with the new brand identity the college was creating, ensuring transparency and relevance. I wanted to answer the big questions every potential student has when considering a major: What is it? What are the classes like? What can I do with it? And how much will it cost me?

          <br>
          <br>
          The web team was happy with my template and implemented it on the site. My work is still being used today to develop program page content.
