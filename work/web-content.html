      <h4>content strategy / design</h4> 
        <p>
          A local dog-breeding business was looking to redesign their site and move from Weebly to a new CMS. Initially, I created a site using Wordpress; however, the back-end user interface wasn’t what the company was looking for, proving to be difficult to maintain. Additionally, Wordpress themes and plugins create significant manual upkeep and can create security vulnerabilities. As an alternative, I recommended we move to Squarespace, a more secure CMS with an approachable back-end interface. Though I had rewritten their content during the first redesign, I decided to use this opportunity to further finesse and simplify the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I provided an audit of the existing content to the business, and advised the clients to further pare down and streamline their content. Ultimately, I created new content for the site designed to provide a seamless user experience and establish a consistent brand voice and tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuing to work within our established brand guidelines, I began the design process. I selected Squarespace templates and created mock-ups to help my clients choose a final design. Throughout the process, I worked closely with my clients to gather feedback and conduct user testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the site was completed, I met with the owners to go through the Squarespace interface, showing them how to independently maintain their site.

      <h4>content strategy</h4>
        <p>
          While working at Westminster College as the interim director of publications and managing editor, I used my content strategy expertise to assist the college’s web team. The college was in the middle of a complete website redesign and didn’t have a clear vision for the academic program pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I researched industry standards and best practices. My primary goal was to anticipate the needs of our website users&mdash;in this case, prospective college students&mdash;answering questions like “what are the classes like?,” “what can I do with it?,” and “how much will it cost me?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jumping off from my research, I developed an academic program template that both our internal team and freelance writers could use to draft copy. This ensured better consistency across departments, keeping content in-line with the college’s strategic goals and brand identity. 
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The web team implemented the template as a formal part of their content development process, and continues to use it to develop program page content.

      <h4>design</h4> 
        <p>
          My client was looking to redesign her personal website and move from Wordpress to Squarespace. We met initially to discuss her vision for the site, using that information to determine what content should be included and develop an organization strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delving into the design process, I compiled a list of Squarespace templates that fit my client’s vision. We narrowed it down to two, and I created mock sites with each template to help my client choose a final design. Once I had collected all of the content, I worked in Squarespace to create the site, customizing the template as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the site was completed, I provided training on the Squarespace interface, so she could maintain her own site moving forward.
