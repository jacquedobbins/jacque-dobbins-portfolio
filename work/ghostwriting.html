          As a communications specialist and donor relations writer for the advancement team at University of Utah Health, 
          I’ve honed my ghostwriting skills. I’ve written letters from the president and the senior vice president for 
          health sciences and remarks from the executive dean of the School of Medicine and noted researchers from around 
          campus. With each new project, I’ve developed a process of discovery, strategy, and revision that maintains the 
          voice of who I’m writing for, while staying true to the U of U Health brand.
