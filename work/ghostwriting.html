          As a communications specialist for the advancement team at University of Utah Health, I am responsible for writing materials from the president and senior vice president for health sciences, the dean of the School of Medicine, and noted researchers from across campus. With each new project, I’ve honed my ability to lead the discovery, strategy, and revision processes that maintains the voice of who I’m writing for, while staying true to the U of U Health brand.
