          As the communications specialist at the University of Utah, I managed the marketing and communications strategy for the School of Medicineâ€™s annual Alumni Weekend. The weekend includes 10 different class reunions and more than a dozen separate events, including an awards banquet.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I initially met with the alumni association for project discovery, determining exactly what collateral and marketing was needed and establishing a project timeline. We also discussed the visual aesthetic of the weekend and their preferred voice and tone within the new U of U Health brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed content strategy and collaborated with the alumni association to draft copy for all marketing materials, including letters, emails, invitations, fliers, ads, banners, and programs. I also designed and built a website for the event through Shopify.
