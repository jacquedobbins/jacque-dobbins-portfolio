  <h3 class="project-tag">Communications strategy with a heavy dose of marketing and writing.</h3>
  <section class="project-content">
    <div class="project-text">
      <h4>Overview</h4>    
        <p>
          As the communications specialist for the university&mdash;first full-time, then as freelance&mdash;I was responsible for the marketing and communications strategy for the U of U Health Office of Advancement. I developed and executed communications plans, wrote endless copy, edited everything we produced, and created new branded templates for our many pieces of collateral.
        </p>
      <h4>Audience</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Donors</li>
          <li>Alumni</li>
          <li>Campus stakeholders</li> 
          <li>U of U community</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>   
        <p>
          When I joined the university, I joined a small, newly created team. Previously, the health advancement office had worked with the university’s central marcomm team, but found they needed an embedded communications team of their own. Needless to say, there was a lot of work and very little strategy. On top of that, U of U Health had just undergone a rebrand and campus stakeholders were struggling to maintain brand consistency. We needed a game plan.
        </p>
      <h4>Strategy</h4>  
        <p>
          Within weeks of starting, I knew we needed to stop being reactionary and develop a solid workflow and communications strategy. We needed some level of organization. I sat down with the team and audited every communications and marketing piece the office had produced or wanted to produce. And piece by piece I outlined a process and vision for our work. I gave each type of collateral clear content requirements and timelines. I also identified how we could reimagine the look and feel of everything from case statements and proposals to landing pages and invitations. I was responsible for not only the strategy, but also the execution, so I got to work.
        </p>
      <h4>Project</h4>
        <h5>Alumni Weekend</h5>
          <p>
            Our largest recurring project was handling the marketing and communications strategy for the School of Medicine’s annual Alumni Weekend, which entails 10 different class reunions and more than a dozen separate events, including an awards banquet. And I was taking lead.    
          </p>
          <p>
            I started by auditing the collateral for previous weekends and holding discovery meetings with various campus stakeholders. In the process, I identified and streamlined our comm flow, zeroing in on the most important and effective marketing pieces and establishing a clear timeline. Next, I went to work on the content and design. I knew what we needed, now I wanted to clarify our message and elevate our visual aesthetic, aligning it with the U of U Health brand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked with freelance designers to create a visual identity for the weekend, making it stand out from the noise of campus events. And I developed a content strategy, collaborating with the alumni association to draft copy for all marketing materials, including web copy, letters, emails, invitations, fliers, ads, banners, and programs. I executed each piece of content from start to finish while overseeing the project timeline and managing freelancers and other team members. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The marketing and communications for the weekend&mdash;and process as a whole&mdash;were so successful that our team was asked to manage the communications for the alumni weekends of the College of Nursing and College of Health as well.
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          Having the opportunity to build a communications strategy from nothing was an invaluable experience. It gave me expertise in not only marketing and content strategy, but also project management and team leadership. And being responsible for the execution as well as ideation meant that I honed my writing and editing skills. My work paid off. After leaving the university to pursue a new challenge, they asked that I continue on as freelance, managing many of the same projects—including all three alumni weekends.
