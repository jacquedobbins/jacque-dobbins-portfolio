          During my time as executive editor of the Myriad, I led a team of four to transform Westminster College’s traditional, often unread academic journal into an interactive, digital publication. I led the Myriad team to develop a brand identity, strategize content, and coordinate the editing and production processes.

        <p>
          My vision was to create a journal that was not only beautiful and innovative in a world of stale academic journals, but that would also provide content that our audience&mdash;from students to researchers&mdash;would want to read. I reworked the submission and review process, focusing on advancing work that was intriguing and timely. The research mattered, but so did the story it told and how it fit into the current social climate.
