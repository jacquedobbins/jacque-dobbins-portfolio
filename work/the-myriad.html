          During my time as executive editor of The Myriad, I led a team of four students to transform Westminster College’s 
          traditional, often unread academic journal into an interactive, digital publication. I led the Myriad team to develop 
          a brand identity, strategize content, and coordinate the editing and production processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a vision that not only would the journal be beautiful and innovative in a world of stale academic journals, 
          but that it would have content that people—from students to researchers—would want to read. I reworked the submission 
          and review process, focusing on advancing work that was intriguing and timely. The research mattered, but so did the story 
          it told and how it fit into the current social climate.
