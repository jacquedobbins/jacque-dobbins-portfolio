        <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            As the lead copywriter and content strategist for the college, I was responsible for overseeing every piece of content on the college’s 500+ page website. I ideated, overhauled, edited, and wrote endless pages of web content and worked closely with the UX lead to develop the overall strategic vision for the college’s website.
          </p>
        <h4>Audience</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Undergraduate students</li>
            <li>Graduate students</li>
            <li>Campus stakeholders</li> 
          </ul>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
          <p>
            When I began my position at Westminster, I joined an entirely new web team&mdash;and a small one at that. With 500+ pages of content, numerous web requests daily, and no clear strategy, I knew we had some challenges to overcome. The biggest, to put it simply, was too much content. The information architecture was confusing, which was having a detrimental effect on navigation and the user experience.
          </p>
        <h4>Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            When I started my position there wasn’t any clear vision to speak of, so I knew we needed to develop an overarching web strategy. Like I said, it was a brand-spanking&mdash;new web team, and with so many web requests coming in, the best we could do initially was tread water. We needed a way to evaluate and prioritize each request while also moving the website and content forward with projects that aligned with college-wide priorities. So, I pushed the team to sit down and hash out our vision.
          <p>
            Once we had the opportunity to brainstorm, our strategy was crystal clear: continue to support college priorities and enrollment efforts by curating and improving the user experience. And we had a slew of projects in the queue to help us do just that.
          </p>
        <h4>Projects</h4>
          <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
            <p>
              My number one priority was to eliminate pages&mdash;unsurprising. But I didn’t want to start deleting pages left and right&mdash;again, unsurprising.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I had my team audit all of the pages on the website. I wanted to know where we stood: How many pages? How were they distributed? Which audiences were they serving? Then I turned to my constant friend, analytics, to get a clearer picture of how certain pages and hubs were performing. I looked at conversion rates, bounce rates, general traffic, SEO performance, etc. to pinpoint the pain points of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Armed with my arsenal of data, I began the process of developing a structure that made sense and outlining a logical navigation that got users where they wanted to go. And, yes, deleting so many pages. I identified a few different hubs of content based on type and audience and started reorganizing the website, hub by hub.
            </p>
          <h5>Content Hubs</h5>
            <p>
              While many of the college’s high-level pages had been reworked prior to my arrival, there were numerous hubs of content that hadn’t been touched. Using the college-wide priorities and brand as my guiding light, I went to work identifying and overhauling content.
            </p>
            <h6>Residence Life</h6>
              <p>
                Increasing the number of students who lived on campus was a priority for the college, and the new president made it mandatory for the first two years. The residence life pages needed to reflect that&mdash;and sell it. Knowing that these pages were a big factor in helping students see themselves at the college, I worked on making the content engaging, fun, and most importantly, on-brand. I collaborated with campus stakeholders and the UX lead to develop a design and structure that would provide users with seamless navigation and an engaging experience. In terms of content, I balanced required information with more compelling content that would make students excited about on-campus living.
              </p>
            <h6>Tuition and Aid</h6>
              <p>
                My largest project was addressing the college’s tuition and aid content. To put it bluntly, it was a mess. We knew users were struggling to find anything, and what they did find was confusing and out of date. I performed a full audit of all pages related to tuition and aid, tallying up 41 different pages, many of which were unnecessary and unusable. On top of that, the content wasn’t on-brand and just wasn’t engaging or clear. I evaluated each and every page and developed a simplified structure, reducing the number of pages by more than half and organizing them into three main sections. Finally, I rewrote every piece of content, focusing on making it as clear and straightforward as possible. Paying for college is overwhelming enough, I wanted these pages to help users through the process with ease. And I wanted to have a little fun with it.
              </p>
            <h6>Giving</h6>
              <p>
                A much smaller-scale project, but a difficult one nonetheless was the college’s giving hub. The advancement office needed to better communicate to potential donors about giving priorities. Where the challenge came in was balancing the wants of the client with web best practices and college priorities. Basically, we wouldn’t or couldn’t do some of what they wanted, but we needed to communicate that in a way that preserved a good relationship&mdash;especially since it had been historically tense. I decided to utilize storytelling to help donors connect with the college and the student experience. Working with the client, I streamlined and rewrote the existing content, ensuring it had a clear narrative while remaining focused. I also developed creative solutions to some of their requests, providing the content they wanted in a way that the web team felt good about.
              </p>
        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
          <p>
            In the end, my work with the college was challenging but rewarding. Having the ability to lead and tackle some large projects gave me expertise in not only content strategy and copywriting, but also UX, IA, analytics, and SEO. And my efforts paid off. Analytics showed a 33% increase in traffic to academic (conversion) pages, a 22% decrease in global bounce rate, and a 15% increase in academic applications via the website.
