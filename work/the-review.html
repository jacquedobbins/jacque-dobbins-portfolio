          After working in Westminsterâ€™s Office of Marketing and Communications for two years, I became the interim director of
          publications and managing editor of the alumni Review magazine. During my time working on the magazine, I worked with
          our team to create production timelines, brainstorm story ideas, determine story assignments, ensure writers met deadlines,
          schedule photoshoots, and edit draft copy and layouts.

          I also handled updating the Review website, uploading and formatting new issues and producing articles between publications.
