      <h3>writing</h3> 
        <p>
          In my role as a communications specialist  with University of Utah Health, I tackled many technical subjects, from genetic sequencing as a means of diagnosing mystery illnesses in children to ethics research for medical device innovation.

          Technical writing requires curiosity and leaves no room for ego. It’s my job to work with industry experts and help them find the best ways to communicate and translate their message to a broader audience. This work also challenged me to adapt my writing voice to fit the audience I’m writing to, whether that’s donors, researchers, or the public.

      <h3>editing</h3>
        <p>
          I began working as a freelance technical editor four years ago, working primarily with corporations dealing with nuclear engineering, remediation, and environmental safety. I am not an expert in those fields, but I know editing. I’ve learned that I can pick up other knowledge as needed, as long as my editing skills are up to snuff.

          Technical editing is vastly different from editing an article or a novel. It requires immense focus and attention to detail&mdash;and a lot of research. It’s difficult to know if a word is spelled or being used incorrectly when it’s the first time you’ve ever seen it. Just as technical writing required prior research, technical editing is a process of continual research and questioning.
