      <h3>writing</h3> 
        <p>
          In my role as a communications specialist and donor relations writer with University of Utah Health, I tackled many
          technical subjects that required detailed research before I could write even one sentence—from genetic sequencing to 
          diagnose mystery illnesses in children to hearing restoration as a tool to prevent dementia and ethics research for 
          medical device innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical writing requires curiosity and leaves no room for ego. It’s my job to work to those with the knowledge, 
          helping them figure out how to best communicate and translate their message. This work also challenged me to adapt 
          my writing voice and tone to best fit the audience I’m writing to,whether that’s donors, researchers, or the public.

      <h3>editing</h3>
        <p>
          I began working as a freelance technical editor four years ago, working primarily with corporations dealing with 
          nuclear engineering and remediation and environmental safety. I am not an expert in those fields—it would be challenge 
          to pass a college-level course. However, I know editing. I’ve learned that I can pick up the other knowledge as 
          needed, as long as my editing skills are up to snuff.
        </p>

          Technical editing is vastly different from editing an article or a novel. It requires immense focus and attention 
          to detail—and a lot of research. It’s difficult to know if a word is spelled or being used incorrectly when it’s 
          the first time you’ve ever seen it. Just as technical writing required prior research, technical editing is a 
          process of continual research and questioning.
