          As the communications specialist at the University of Utah, I managed the marketing and communications strategy
          and collateral for the School of Medicineâ€™s annual Alumni Weekend. The weekend includes 10 different class 
          reunions and a dozen or so separate events, including an awards banquet.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I initially met with the alumni association for project discovery, determining exactly what collateral and
          marketing was needed and when it needed to go out. We also discussed the visual aesthetic of the weekend and 
          their preferred voice and tone within the new U of U Health brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          After our initial meeting, I developed a content strategy and collaborated with the alumni association to draft
          copy for all marketing, including a website, letters, emails, invitations, fliers, ads, banner, and a program. 
          I also handled all the design and the creation of the website through Shopify.
